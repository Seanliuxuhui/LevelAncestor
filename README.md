# LevelAncestor
Different implementation of finding level ancestor
### Static Macro-Micro-Tree
The implementation of Static trees where the shape and size of tree is known before constructing the Macro-Micro-Tree
### Dynamic Macro-Micro-Tree
The implementation of the Dynamic trees where the leaves are inserting into the tree dynamically. 
### Dynamic Macro-Micro-tree Using Table Algorithm
Using table algorithm (dynamic programming) to store elements for each leaf
